##About this repository

Hi there!   
This is **Chandan Sinha**.  
I'm a junior year B.Tech Student in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Department from IIT Hyderabad.  
Exposure to programming has been one of the most significant that happened in my life. It was in my second semester in college. After that I fell in love with it and now I'm a passionate coder.  
These are the files for my personal website I designed for a consolidated online identity.  
Feel free to contact me via email or phone. You can also find the things I'm currently working on. Also I've added links to other website for my portfolio.    
I blog at [Divine_Lifez](https://thevindicatedaxiom.wordpress.com) on Wordpress.   
Hope you like it. Thanks for stopping by :)

###Note
I'm currently redesigning my site with **Angular Material** framework. I'll add all my portfolio projects (academic, non-academic & personal) there. Till then you can find my resume [here](mechanicalcoder.github.io/assets/resume.pdf)
