      security concerns, many users are currently experiencing problems running NASA Glenn
      educational applets. There are
      <a href="javaset.html">security settings</a> that you can adjust that may correct
      this problem.

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With this software you 
    can investigate how a turbine (or jet) engine produces 
    thrust by changing the values of different engine 
    parameters.  If you are an experienced EngineSim user, you 
    can use a slightly different <a href="Turbo.html">version </a>
    of the program which does not include these instructions.

<i>
Recently (2013), there have been several security patches added to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
As a result of the security patches, EngineSim does not always perform as it did in the past. Since you have 
downloaded this version of the program, you may experience some of these problems. One patch
does not allow the display of .gif images from a local directory. So you will not be able to see the engine
animations in Tunnel Test Mode or any of the component pictures on the output panel at the lower right which were available on earlier versions.
We have maintained all the functionality of previous versions, but just do not display any photos.

           This program is designed to be interactive, so you have to work with the program.
           There are several different types of widgets that you use to work with the program.
<ol>
     <li>
           There are a variety of choices which you must make regarding the analysis and the display
           of results by using a <b>choice box</b>.
           A choice box has a descriptive word displayed and an arrow at the right of the
           box. To make a choice, click on either the arrow or the current choice word, hold down,
           and drag to make your selection. The new selection is indicated by a change in the word.
           <i> A recent security patch has changed the way that choice boxes operate. 
              This can result in a condition where you can't change from Imperial to Metric units. 
              To overcome this problem, we have included an <b>Override</b> option on the choice boxes
              on the control panel. If you get stuck, click on <b>Override</b> then click on your choice; 
              it will then work correctly.
            </i> 
    </li><li>
           The current values of the design variables are presented to you in <b>text boxes</b>. 
           By convention, a white box with
           black numbers is an input box and you can change the value of the number. A black box with
           yellow or red numbers is an output box and the value has been computed by the program.
           To change the value in an input box, select the box by moving the cursor into the box
           and clicking the mouse, then backspace over the old number, enter a new number,
           then hit the <b>Enter</b> key on your keyboard. <b>You must hit Enter
           to send the new value to the program.</b>
    </li><li>
           For most input variables you can also use a <b>slider</b> located next to the input box.
           Click on the slider bar, hold down and drag the slider bar to change values, or
           you can click on the arrows at either end of the slider.
           <i>If you experience difficulties when using the sliders to change variables,
           simply click away from the slider and then back to it.</font>

           the arrows on the end of the sliders disappear, click in the areas
           where the left and right arrow images should appear, and they
           should reappear.</i>

           Some graphics decisions are selected by pushing <b>buttons</b>. 
           To push a button, move the cursor over the button and click the mouse.

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ENGINE DESIGN PROCESS:</font>
</p>   
<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can
      choose from four different types of engines: a simple
      turbojet, a jet with afterburner,
      a turbofan engine, or a ramjet.
    Selections are made on the graphics window by clicking on the engine name. The chosen
    engine is shown in yellow. Depending on the engine type, different input panels appear 
    at the lower left.
</font>
</p>
             <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              The design process begins by selecting the design Flight Conditions.
              The Flight input panel lets you change the Mach number, airspeed, altitude, pressure,
              temperature, and throttle and afterburner settings. There are several different
              combinations of these variables available for input using the choice button
              on the input panel. The pressure and temperature are computed as functions
              of the altitude by using a Standard Day atmospheric model.
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Design
              variables for each engine component can also be varied.
              The variables include the Inlet (pressure recovery), Fan (pressure
              ratio, efficiency, and bypass ratio), Compressor (CPR, compressor
              efficiency), Burner (fuel,maximum temperature, efficiency, pressure ratio),
              Turbine (turbine efficiency) and Nozzle (maximum temperature, efficiency,
              A8/A2). As you choose a different component the part of the engine
              being affected is highlighted in the graphic by changing from its
              default color to yellow. And a new input panel will appear at the lower left.
              If you change the Output Display to Photos
              you can view an actual photograph and description of each engine
              part.

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Engine
              Size can be specified by either the frontal area or the diameter.
              As the engine size changes, the grid background changes in
              proportion to the size. The distance between any
              two grid lines is 1 foot.
             </font></p>
   <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MATERIALS
      INPUT</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The program
      will calculate an average weight of the engine that
      you design. The thrust to weight ratio of the engine
      is displayed in the numerical output and is a measure of the efficiency of
      the engine. The weight depends on the number of stages in the compressor and
      turbine, the diameter (frontal area) of the engine, and the component materials.
      The program begins with standard materials for the components, but you can
      change the materials and see the effects on weight of the engine. Just push
      the blue Materials choice button on any component input panel. You
      can also select to define your own material by choosing My Material from the
      menu. Just type in your own values for material density and temperature limit.
    </p><p>
      The program will check the temperature throughout the engine design against
      the material limits. If you exceed a limit, a flashing warning will occur
      in the schematic. You can see the temperature limits by choosing <b>Graphs</b>
      in the Output display of the control panel. Then select <b>Temperature</b>
      as the type of graphics display. (For the afterburner and the ramjet, the graphical
      temperature limits are based on the flow temperature, not on the material
      temperature, and are slightly higher than the material limits. Cooling airflow
      is often used along the walls of these components to keep the material temperature
      within limits.)

      Mode, Units, Output Display
</font>
</p>
             <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
              program works in two modes: Design or Tunnel Test Mode. In the Design
              Mode, you can change design variables including the flight conditions,
              the engine size, the inlet performance,
              the turbo machinery compressor and turbine
              performance, the combustors or burner
              performance, or the nozzle performance.
              For a turbofan engine design you can
              also vary the fan performance and the bypass ratio.
              In Design Mode, any change in an input parameter produces a new engine
              design. You have to be very careful when drawing conclusions about
              the effects of input variables on performance because you are not comparing the effects
              on the same engine.
             </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              In Tunnel Test Mode
              you can vary only the flight conditions and you can not change
              any of the component design parameters except the throttle setting.
              The values of some of the parameters like inlet recovery and nozzle area
              may change according to choices that you made during design.
              In Tunnel Test Mode you are evaluating the off-design performance
              of the engine model which you specified in Design Mode.
              In Tunnel Test mode, you can load models
              of existing turbine engines for comparison with your design. You
              can always reload your design to continue testing. In Design Mode,
              you can use the existing engine models as good starting points for
              your design.

              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 22 Aug
                01 version 1.5b was released. This version includes more corrections
                to the ramjet analysis and some slight changes to the variable limits.
                A "sleek" version of the program is now available for experienced users.</font> </li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 19 Apr 01 version 
                1.5 was released. This version includes improved graphics and a more consistent
                input environment. There are also corrections to the ramjet analysis from
                previous versions.</font>        </li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 13 Oct 00 version
               1.4 was released. This version includes material properties for each component
               and a calculation of the engine weight. Temperature limits for each component
               are also checked. </font>        </li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 26 Sept 00 version 
               1.3 was released. This version uses the "card format"
               for input and output. Component input panels are invoked from the engine
               graphic. Optional photos of the components are included on the output panel. </font>        </li>
