# Hi Everyone!

For so long I have been thinking of setting up a proper techblog for myself. One that would give the feel of being a real technical corner of amusement - a geeky touch. A sneak peek into the life of an aspiring Product Designer presented from a learner's perspective.

I love creative writing and for that I have been blogging on wordpress for over two years now. You can find my blog [here](https://thevindicatedaxiom.wordpress.com). I also started the category named [**techblog**](https://thevindicatedaxiom.wordpress.com/category/techblog) there but I wasn't fully satisfied with this mocktail of two entirely diverse interests. Science with philosophy is indeed a dangerous combination. 

I love learning new things that spans [wide range of things](https://about.me/chandan_sinha) but mostly its all about exciting technology. Latest or obselete, innovation has always fascinated me and when I experience it first hand, my joy knows no bound. The tech-enthusiast inside me always wanted to ramble its learning endeavour - for the sake of documentation and for helping the passionately curious beings like me out there.

So I looked into the alternatives and found this awesome static site generator ['Pelican'](http://getpelican.com/) powered by python. It allows me to write down things in Markdown, which I make most of my notes in anyway.

I am really excited to finally have a separate techblog. Hope you would find this interesting. Stay tuned and keep reading about my journey through technical extravaganza of **_making things that matter_**.

If you're a complete beginner & interested in knowing what exactly did I write in Markdown for this post, here is the markdown gist for you. Enjoy!
